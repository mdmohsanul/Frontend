# Static Site Generation

- Generate on Build Time

- In this approach in build time only the webpage is generated and then stored on the server
- So the build phase will take longer time

- Suppose if we have a blog page so we don't write blog every second,
  probably we write once a day or a week so we don't need to buld again and again when a new blog is created we can build webpage again.

- Now server will take no load all it has all the webpages there all it needs to do is when the client make request just send the webpage

# Server Side Rendering

- Generate on each request
- The rendering will happen on server side. means server takes majority of the load.
- The Client request a webpage and based on the request a webpage is generated in server then sent it to client.
- All the HTML, CSS and Js will sent in just one go

- Server has having higher computing power as compared client so thats why SSR are faster than CSR

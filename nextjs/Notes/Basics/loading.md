# Benefits of loading.tsx

- It gives users immediate feedback when they navigate somewhere new.
  This makes your app feel snappy and responsive, and users know their click actually did something.

- Next.js keeps shared layouts interactive while new content loads.
   Users can still use things like navigation menus or sidebars even if the main content isn't ready yet.

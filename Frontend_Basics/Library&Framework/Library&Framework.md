## Library

- A library is usually a collection of functions, classes or utilities.
- We can call when you need them. 
- We could control the flow of our program.

Example:
React (technically a library for building UI, you decide how to use components).
Tailwind CSS (it gives utilities classes)

## Framework

- A framework provides a structure and rules for how your application should be built. 
- It often calls your code at the right time (this is called Inversion of Control).

Express.js (framework for Node.js backend).
Bootstrap -  It Provides ready-made components (navbar, modals, grid system, buttons, etc.) along with utility classes.

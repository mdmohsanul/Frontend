# Cross Browser Compatibility

- It ensures that our websites and web apps should consistently works across all browsers and devices.
- Different browsers have different rendering engines so they may interpret Javascript, HTML and CSS differently.

So to manage these conflicts we have some best practices

1. Use Autoprefixer and PostCSS (comes with bundler)
- adds browser specific CSS

2. Use Normalize.css

3. Use Polyfills for JS (core-js / regenerator-runtime)

4. Test in multiple browser
 
5. Use tools like - BrowserStack, Responsively, LambdaTest

6. Check compatibility in (canIUse.com)

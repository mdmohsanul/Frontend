# It's 2025 and SEO is Dead?

- Before 2020 there were page rank , keywords game and back link game were there to rank our website on top

- But now we in 2025 what happens if you have money then run ads and get traffic from there and easily rank your website.

Google Tracks everything and then they decide your website rank
- CTR (click through rate): how much time your website searched
- Bounce rate: after opening the website the user will switch to another website, so the time between them is bounce rate.
- DWELL Time: Time spent by the user on the website. (everyone is interesting in increasing the dwell time)
- Load Time: how fast your website opens.

Now two things happens
- If you have a strong content then you don't worry about these CTR, bounce rate etc.
- If you have money then run ads

1. Go to google search console and create account and submit your website
2. Provide link in any social media platform so when google scan that page it will get the link then google index your website

# Backlinks

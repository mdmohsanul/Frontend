### Typescript

- Typescript is superset of javascript. It means everything that you can do in Js that is already available in Ts and a lot more is available to that.

- It helps to write code in more precise manner so that your code have less error in the run time
  Many error are highlighted at the time of writing only by code editors.

# All the code written in typescript will be finally compiled into javascript only.

# TYPESCRIPT IS ALL ABOUT TYPE SAFETY

# TYPESCRIPT is all about static checking

## Typescript is a development tool

- It's a development tool. Our project still runs on JS
- Our projects still runs in javascript the code that you produce or send to production is still a pure Js.
- So typescript is just a layer on top of Js.
- It helps you to write better code with less problems with more scalable and maintainable code that is easily understandable.
- Its not a standalone Language in itself.

# What typescript does

- Typescript is just for static checking.(languages with static checking : java,golang)
- It analyze your code and help you to understand that you might be running into an error without even running the code and
  getting the errors at the runtime itself thats all it does.

# type aliases

- Type aliases is like creating our own datatype
- Suppose if in our code there are 10 function using similar values so instead of passing them one by one in the parameter we just write it in a separate file or in same file then pass them as a type in parameter and the values in the argument

# Union types

- It allows us to be in a situation where we are not sure about what type of data is going to come in, it might be a number it might be a string .
- instead of using any it is highly recommended to use Union
- Union is a combination of two, three or more data types that you can include into a variable or array

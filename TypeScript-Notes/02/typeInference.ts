/*  ------------- type inference ------------

Typescript is smart enough that if we declare a variable and assigned a number value then we don't have to explicitely define
the type.
So, In every declaration of variable we don't needed to define the type. Typescript automatically detects.
the typescript is smart enough to get all the values and if we were assigning immediately we don't need to put colon and
declare the type.

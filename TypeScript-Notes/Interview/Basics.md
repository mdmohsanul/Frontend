# 1. What is TypeScript?

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking and modern language features.
- Ts eventually compiled (Transpiled) into plain javaScript, so it runs anywhere Js run (browser, Node.js)
- It helps catch error during development(at compile time), instead of waiting runtime error in javascript.

So, basically typescript provide more safer, maintainable and scalable code.

# Features of TypeScript?

1. Type Safety

Prevents runtime errors by catching type issues early.
Supports type inference (no need to always declare types explicitly).

2. Better Tooling & Autocomplete

IDEs like VS Code give intellisense, auto-completion, and inline documentation.

3. Maintainability

Makes large codebases easier to manage.
Self-documenting code because types describe expected inputs/outputs.

4. Modern Features

Includes ESNext features (async/await, decorators, etc.) before theyâ€™re natively available.
Easier Refactoring
Strong typing makes renaming variables, functions, or classes safer.

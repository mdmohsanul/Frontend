# What is React?
- React is a JavaScript Library developed by facebook developers. 
- It is used for building reusable User Interfaces especially for SPA's
- It allows developers to divide the code into small components so that they can manage their own state and render UI efficiently.

# Features of React

* Component based architecture:
  UI is broken into reusable components (e.g., buttons, forms).
  Components manage their own state and can be composed to build complex UIs.

* Efficient updates Virtual DOM (Performance Optimization)
  React uses a Virtual DOM to minimize direct manipulation of the real DOM, making updates faster.
  Instead of re-rendering the entire page, it only updates the changed parts.

* One-Way Data Binding
  Data flows in one direction (from parent to child).
  Ensures predictability and easier debugging.

* Community and ecosystem
  React has large and active developer community and rich ecosystem of libraries and tools

* Cross Platform
  React can be used for both web and mobile development.(React Native)

- Limitations

* SEO Challenges
  React uses client-side rendering (CSR), which may not be ideal for SEO (Solution: Use Next.js for SSR).

* Fast-Paced Updates
  Frequent updates may lead to outdated codebases and also difficult to maintain documentation.

* React covers only UI layer of application so you still need to choose other technologies for building an web application.

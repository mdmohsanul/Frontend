1. What are states in react?

- State in React refers to a built-in object (or value) used to store data that can change over time and trigger re-renders of the component when updated.

2. Key Points About React State:-
   ✅ Local to the component (unlike props, which are passed down).
   ✅ Used for dynamic behavior (e.g., toggling modals, form inputs, API data).
   ✅ Updated with setState in class components & useState in functional components.

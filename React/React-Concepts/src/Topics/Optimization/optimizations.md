# Image Optimization Best Practices (Production-grade)

1. Lazy Loading

I would use lazy loading so images outside the viewport don’t block initial page load — this can be implemented using the Intersection Observer API or libraries like react-lazyload.

2. Next-gen Formats

- Use WebP or AVIF for better compression and quality compared to JPEG/PNG.
- Fallback to traditional formats for unsupported browsers.

3. Responsive Images

- Serve different image sizes with srcset for different screen sizes.Prevents downloading unnecessarily large images on mobile.
- The HTML srcset attribute provides the browser with a list of image sources and their widths or pixels.

4. Compression & Optimization

- Compress images (lossy or lossless) using tools like ImageOptim, Squoosh, or Sharp.
- Strip unnecessary metadata to reduce file size.


5. Progressive Enhancement

- Use placeholders / blurred previews (e.g., LQIP, blurred base64 placeholders).
- Improves perceived performance.

6. Accessibility & SEO

- Always include alt text for screen readers and search engines.

- Using React.lazy with Suspense to reduce the initial load times.
- Use tree-shaking (via Webpack/Vite/Rollup) to remove unused code.
- Split large dependencies (like Lodash, Chart.js) into smaller imports.
- Use dynamic imports for rarely-used modules

– Distribute assets across global servers to serve content faster from the nearest location to the user.

1. Avoid Unnecessary Re-renders

- Use React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo to prevent re-creating values/functions that cause child components to re-render unnecessarily.
- Split large components into smaller ones so only the parts that need updates re-render.

2. Manage State 

- Keep state local (component-level) if it’s only used in one place.
- Lift state up only when needed; avoid putting everything in global state.
- Use Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or Jotai for predictable, optimized global state management.

- Don’t overload client state with server data. Use libraries like React Query or RTK Query to handle caching, refetching, and background updates efficiently.

– Use pagination, infinite scrolling, and GraphQL batching to fetch only necessary data, reducing load times.
- Use optimization techniques like debouncing and throttling to limit the rate of execution of a function.

# 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 & 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗔𝘂𝗱𝗶𝘁𝘀

– Regularly run Lighthouse and Web Vitals audits to measure performance, SEO, and accessibility improvements.

# Monitoring & Profiling

Use React Profiler to detect slow components.
Use Chrome DevTools to analyze rendering, memory, and network bottlenecks.
Continuously monitor Core Web Vitals in production using tools like Sentry or New Relic.

## Why we are importing React and React-Dom into our web projects

React gives us the core functionality of react
React-Dom gives us the functionality to update or manipulate the DOM and are used for developing web applications
and if we develop mobile applications then we have to use 'React-Native'.

## The most costly opertions inside webpage is when the DOM nodes needs to be manipulated (for eg: if we hide or show something or on the click of the button we do some operations)

So all these Libraries and Frameworks are trying to optimize DOM operations.

React can work independently in small portion of our app as well thats why it is library

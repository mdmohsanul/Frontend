== It converts the operands into same type then converts them
=== It checks for same data type and same operands/content. Also known for strict equality check

ðŸ”¹ == (Loose Equality)
Compares values, but allows type coercion.

ðŸ”¹ === (Strict Equality)
Compares both value AND type.

No type conversion â€” if types differ, it returns false.

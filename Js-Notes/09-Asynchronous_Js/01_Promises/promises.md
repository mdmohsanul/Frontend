# What is promise?

A promise is an object respresenting the eventual completion(or failure) of an asynchronous operations and its resulting value. Promises provided a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations as compared to callbacks.

whenever we execute promise it returns an object which has two properties
Promise:{
PromiseState:"pending", -> State tells us in which state our promise is
PromiseResult:undefined -> Result will store whatever data promise returned
}
Promises have three states:

- pending -> when we create a promise our promise is in pending state. It means the operation has started but not yet finished.
- fulfilled -> when our operation is success and returns data to the result.
- rejected -> if the promise was not resolved due to some error then it goes to rejected state.

# Pros of using promises

1. Avoid callback hell by chaining .then().
2. Better error handling with catch().

# Cons of using promises

1. Still requires chaining which can get verbose.
2. Not as intuitive as asynchronous code.

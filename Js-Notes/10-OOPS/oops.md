# javascript and classes

# What is object -- collection of methods and properties

# why use oop --

# parts of oop

- object literal

- constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new,this)

# 4 pillars of OOPS

- Abstraction -> It helps in hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionalities.
- Encapsulation ->
- Inheritance ->
- Polymorphism ->

- new keyword ->
  when we use new then an empty object will be created (called instance).
  constructor function will be called due to new keyword, then it will pack all the arguments and give it to us.
  then all the arguments were injected into this
  then a last we get all inside a function

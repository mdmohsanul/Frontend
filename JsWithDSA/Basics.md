### Ways to learn DSA - Requires 6 months

## DSA Prep mindset

- Language Basics, Problem Solving, Logic Solving, Patterns

## Big 0 ->

- space and time complexity
- scalability
- rules and graphs
- practice some exercises

## Strings

- Basic nature , Immutable nature
- indexing, iterating, Concatenation , Substring extraction
- Case Conversion, trimming, split and join with array
- Replace Character, Substring, Reversing, Palindromes, Anagram, Longest Substring

## Array

- Understand Array -> Dynamic vs Static Array
- Memory Allocation (Access and Storage)
- Operations
  •
  • Accessing and updating elements
  • Insertion, deletion (end, start, middle)
  • Forward, backward traversal
- Multi Dimensional
  • Access
  • Matrices
- Manipulation
  • Reverse
  • Rotate
  • Shuttle
  • Radomization

## Patterns

• Two Pointer
• Sliding Window
• Sub Array

## Searching and Sorting

- Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick
- Linear Search, Binary Search

## Linked Lists

- Nodes and Pointers, Comparision with Array
- Singly, Doubly, Circular
- Implementation
  • Node with Data and Pointer
  • Constructors
  • Head / Tail reference
  • Utility functions (isEmpty, size)
  • Insertion, Deletion, Searching
- Advance Techniques
  • Two Pointers
  • Reverse
  • Merge & Split
- Patterns
  • Detecting cycle
  • Finding Mid
  • Nth node from end

## Stack and Queue

- Stack (LIFO) - In a buffet you pick the plate which is kept last
- Queue (FIFO) - In Dominos you place order and then recieve order.
- Basic operations - Push, Pop, Peek
  • Circular
  • Add, remove, front
  • Underflow & Overflow
- BFS, Round Robin
- Balancing Symbol, Reverse a Queue
- Thread- safe Implementation
